 # Add App linking to PWA (1.2.3)

This task has a dependency on [Task 1.1.5](115_Add_WIndows_Features.md) and all of it's prerequisites

## Task 

In this BONUS task, you want to configure your PWA to handle all requests that are send to your domain URL.  For example you should be able to create a link in a file or email that navigates to https://YOURSITENAME.azruewebsites.net/receiving and have that open the receiving section of your PWA instead of your website.   This is a stretch goal, and it takes a bit of manual configuration to work.

1. Update your local manifest.xml (what you downloaded from pwabuilder.com)

2. Add JSON object to web site

3. add activation object to website

4. Redeploy site

5. reinstall your local app
